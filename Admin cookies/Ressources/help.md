Hereâ€™s an example of a well-structured `README.md` file that includes code snippets. The example assumes it's for a project involving a React-based application.

# Cookies 

When checking the cookies of the application you find a list of values including

```
I_am_admin=68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327
I_am_admin=false

```

This cookie appears to store sensitive data (e.g., an encoded admin flag or privilege level).
If the encoding is weak (e.g., MD5 without salting), attackers might decode or brute-force it to escalate privileges.
Attackers can easily modify this value (false to true) using browser developer tools or tools like Burp Suite, gaining unauthorized admin access.

## Exploitation
I determined the hashing algorithm used to create the string with the help of a Cipher Identifier to find out it was MD5
Then i executed a MD5 Decoder to find that the value was false
And same way i decoded true and replaced the value with 

```
I_am_admin=b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09
I_am_admin=true

```

## Why is This Important 

Unsecured cookies can compromise user privacy, allow unauthorized actions, and lead to data breaches. Proper cookie management is essential to secure modern web applications.

## Prevention and Mitigation Strategies
a) Do Not Store Sensitive Flags in Cookies
Avoid storing critical information (e.g., user roles, access levels) in cookies. Instead, use a server-side session to manage privileges.
b) Use Server-Side Validation
Store privilege levels or roles in the server database/session. Any user action should be cross-verified with this data.
c) Sign and Encrypt Cookies
Use signed cookies to ensure data integrity. For example:
plaintext
Copy code
I_am_admin=false|HMAC(signature)
The server verifies the signature to detect tampering.
Encrypt cookie data to prevent attackers from understanding or modifying it.
d) Employ Proper Authentication and Authorization
Ensure role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented at the server level, not reliant on client-side data.
e) Set Secure Cookie Attributes
Add flags like HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite to limit exposure and misuse.

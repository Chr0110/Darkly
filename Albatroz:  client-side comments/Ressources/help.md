This curl command tests the server for potential vulnerabilities like:

Referer trust issues (faking the Referer).
User-Agent bypass attempts (custom User-Agent).

## Mitigation Measures:


Remove Debugging Information: Ensure that no debugging data, error messages, or stack traces are exposed in the production environment. Use environment-based logging and ensure errors are handled securely.

Disable Console Logs in Production: Make sure console.log(), console.error(), or any other debug-related console methods are removed or disabled in production code.

Sanitize Comments: Do not include sensitive information like user data, passwords, or configuration details in HTML comments or JavaScript variables.

Never rely on Referer or User-Agent headers for authentication or authorization.

Maintain an updated list of malicious User-Agents and IP addresses for blocking.

Combine CSRF tokens, rate limiting, and behavior analysis to minimize exposure.
